When preparing for interviews or building a serious DevOps portfolio, toy projects won't cut it. You need something that mirrors real-world complexity — and shows you know how to automate, integrate, and deploy across cloud and container platforms.

That’s what I set out to build — and I’m excited to share my open-source [**DevOps Python Automation Project**](https://github.com/arnabdey73/devops-python-automation-project), a hands-on repo that brings together:

🧩 Python scripting  
☁️ Azure infrastructure (Bicep + Terraform)  
🛠️ GitHub Actions CI/CD  
🐳 Kubernetes deployment via Helm  
📊 Monitoring integrations (coming soon with Prometheus/Grafana)

## 👨‍💻 Why I Built This

With 14+ years in IT (8+ in DevOps), I’ve worked with pipelines of all sizes — from legacy monoliths to cloud-native microservices. I wanted to:

* Build a **comprehensive, job-ready portfolio project**
    
* Practice integrating tools that I’ve used professionally
    
* Share something reusable and explainable for the community

## 🛠️ What the Project Covers

### 🔹 Python Automation

Python is the backbone of this project, used to:

* Manage infrastructure workflows
    
* Automate repetitive DevOps tasks
    
* Set up the groundwork for observability tools
    

### 🔹 Infrastructure as Code: Bicep + Terraform

The project provisions Azure infrastructure using:

* **Terraform** for flexible, cloud-agnostic provisioning
    
* **Bicep** for Azure-native, cleaner IaC modules
    

You’ll see how to modularize, version, and structure IaC the right way.

### 🔹 CI/CD with GitHub Actions

The CI/CD pipeline handles:

* Infrastructure validation and deployment
    
* Docker builds
    
* Kubernetes app deployment
    
* Future additions: integration tests, notification hooks
    

### 🔹 Kubernetes + Helm

The Kubernetes manifests are managed through **Helm**, which makes deploying and upgrading apps seamless and version-controlled.
